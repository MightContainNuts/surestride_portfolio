    <h1>Welcome to my Portfolio</h1>

<section><h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I’m Dean, an AI Engineer and Engineering Manager with a passion for building, mentoring, and
            problem-solving. I thrive at the intersection of technology and leadership, whether it’s writing
            Python code, guiding teams through complex engineering challenges, or helping others grow in their careers.
            Mentorship is what drives me the most—I love sharing knowledge, fostering collaboration, and seeing people
            reach their full potential.
        </p>

    <section><h2>Why a portfolio page?</h2>
        <p>
            This portfolio is not just a showcase of my work but also a playground for AI experiments and creative
            ideas. I’ve built this site using modern web technologies, integrating AI-driven features to demonstrate
            practical applications while having a bit of fun along the way. The tech stack includes Python, FastApi,
            and a few other tools that power the backend, while the frontend keeps things sleek and simple. More on
            this on the tech stack page.
        </p>

<section><h2>Final thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            Ultimately, this space reflects my journey in tech—blending engineering, AI, and leadership into something
            meaningful. Whether you’re here to explore my projects, collaborate, or just say hi, welcome!
        </p>
