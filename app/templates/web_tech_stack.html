<h1>How did I build this ?</h1>
<p>Welcome to the technical overview of the portfolio. This page outlines the key technologies that power the web
    applications and AI-driven solutions within this portfolio. The tech stack has been carefully selected to ensure
    high performance, scalability, and the ability to integrate advanced AI capabilities. At the core, Python drives
    the development, enhanced by a robust set of tools and frameworks, including FastAPI for API development and
    SQLModel for efficient database handling. Security is a top priority, with JWT Authentication and OAuth2 ensuring
    safe and seamless user access. In the realm of AI, the portfolio leverages the power of OpenAI, LangChain, and
    LangGraph for sophisticated, language-driven applications. Whether youâ€™re looking for dynamic content generation,
    secure authentication, or cutting-edge AI features, this stack delivers a powerful, flexible foundation for modern
    web and AI-driven solutions.</p>
